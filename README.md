There are three exercises here.

Please do the following


* Run all the tests in each of the exercises
  * They should already pass in exercise 1
  * The should fail in exercises 2 & 3
* Modify the code in exercise 1 to separate functional and nonfunctional requirements
* Make the tests pass in exercises 2 & 3
* When you have done as much as you have time for, whether finished or not, please email me a zip of the files

I do recommend doing these in your own time if you run out of time at work
